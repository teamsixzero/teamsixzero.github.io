      How to scale up your new user testing skills
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are times when conducting one-to-one testing is just not feasible, 
      especially when you’re at the point where you want to test a lot of users 
      at once or on an ongoing basis. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      It’s tough to know when and how to start scaling your testing, but with 
      your swanky new testing skills, you are a lot closer to scaling up your 
      tests than you think. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re looking for less of a hands-on approach or looking to collect 
      massive amounts of insights at once, there are plenty of methods and 
      products out there to help you move into the big leagues of testing so 
      you can efficiently scale up usability testing on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s dive in, shall we?
    </p>

      Unmoderated user testing
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        What is an unmoderated user test?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unmoderated user testing is any test where no facilitator is present 
      while the participant completes tasks or answers questions. Since no one 
      else is present during the study, unmoderated tests are usually conducted 
      using a software application that guides users, records their actions, 
      and asks predetermined follow-up questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of testing works best if you need to validate designs 
      quickly with a large group of participants. Use unmoderated interviews 
      if you have specific questions you need to be answered, you need 
      feedback in a rush, or if you need a large sample size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        How do they work?
    </strong>
    </p>
    <p> 
      Unmoderated interviews allow the participants to complete their testing 
      remotely, at their own pace, on their own time, wherever they want. And 
      since you are not required to be present during each test, you can issue 
      a large number of tests at once and, in return, test a large sample of 
      your targeted users with little effort. Unmoderated testing is also likely 
      to be more cost-effective than having to set up multiple individual 
      tests and be present to facilitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While not having to be present during testing might sound glorious, it does come with some drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p> 
      First, you leave the control in the hands of the participant. Sometimes 
      the feedback you receive can be all over the place or too broad to offer
      the level of insight you need. You also can’t instantly ask a participant 
      for clarification on their answer or ask follow-up questions that may 
      lead to big insights. Further, you cannot provide clarity to your 
        questions if your participant gets confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also have less control over who you might be testing, and let’s face 
      it, some people can be terrible testers providing you only half-baked 
      feedback. Further, you might have little control over how much feedback 
      you receive and parsing through large amounts of data can be slow and 
      tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        When to do unmoderated user testing
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unmoderated user testing is best used when you are comfortable relinquishing 
      control over the test and when you have a comprehensive prototype or even 
      coded version of the thing you're testing. That’s why unmoderated testing 
      really shines when the flow of your test is simple and the goal of what 
      you want to achieve is straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some best use cases are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Copy feedback:</strong> learn how copy makes users feel or see 
        if it leads them to take the action it’s intended to or if it leads to 
        confusion. You can also uncover what words people don’t like and discover 
        phrases that resonate more with the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Basic usability questions:</strong> any user experience that 
        doesn’t require deep user insights. This could be to check if users can log in, 
        navigate to a specific page or complete a submission form. You can 
        also compare the usability of two similar versions to see which one 
        users like more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing final prototypes:</strong>  uncover any last missed bugs, hang-ups or 
        anything that doesn’t require deep user insights to improve before 
        launch.
      </li> 
      <li>
        <strong>Looking for large amounts of feedback:</strong> if you need to gather more 
        data on any of the three scenarios above and want to test a broader 
        sample of users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: If the prototype has lots of deadends or doesn't feel "real" 
      enough, your test is more likely to fail. To cross your Is and dot 
      your Ts, head back to Step 3 where we discuss how to build a <a href="/startusertesting/3-step-3/#make-the-experience-as-real-as-possible" target="_blank">functional 
      test.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Where to start
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re ready to give unmoderated interviews a try, we suggest 
      starting with a platform like <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">Usertesting.com</a>. Usertesting.com lets you 
      choose a target audience to watch as they use your product. You’ll be 
      able to hear them explain their actions in real-time as they interact 
      with a product. Whether it’s prototypes, websites, mobile apps, or even 
      real-world experiences, it’s pretty awesome to witness real-time 
      interaction without ever having to be present for the test.

      UX surveys
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        What is a UX survey?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Need to gather feedback on a live product, gather data about your 
      targeted users or investigate their needs and wants? Surveys, forms and 
      questionnaires are relatively quick and simple methods to all of that. 
      They let you issue a set of questions to collect specific information 
      from a sample of your target user. While the method for issuing a survey 
      is a pretty straightforward approach to gathering feedback (heck, we’ve 
      all filled out a plethora of them in our lifetime), they can render 
      completely useless if you are not careful with your questioning. Let’s 
      dive a little deeper:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        When are UX surveys most effective? 
      </strong>
    </p>  
    <p>
      Surveys are super fast to make and send. And in return, users can 
      quickly answer questions and deliver their feedback on a wide range of 
      topics. Even better, they can be anonymous, which is useful when a level 
      of anonymity will help gain richer feedback. You can issue them to as 
      many people as you’d like without having to be there while they fill 
      them out (talk about efficiency and cost-effectiveness). Perhaps best 
      of all, surveys are a great tool to help inform your design or to help 
      decide what you ask in in-person testing that you may be conducting later. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Surveys, however, fall short when you need to ask follow-up questions 
      when a response gives very little detail. And there’s nothing worse than 
      when someone fills out a survey that ends up generating more questions 
      for you than answers. *Face Palm*.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our experience, the best time to issue surveys is early on when you 
      are trying to understand users more generally, ie. when you’re in your 
      research phase. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Before you jump into building/design
      </li>
      <li>
        When you’re trying to define who your users are or defining what 
        problem they are experiencing
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you kick off usability testing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Pro tips for building successful survey questions
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to ensure that the data and inputs you get out of your 
      surveys are easy to read and analyze while providing the insight you are 
      looking for. The structure of the questions in your survey will influence 
      how the data will come out at the other end of the test session so be sure 
      to use the right type of questions for the data you want to collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close-ended questions like multiple choice or single select options help 
      clearly identify how people respond since users are limited to the options 
      you provide. This will provide data into how people feel about something, 
      but won’t likely provide insight into the ‘why’ behind their response. 
      Which, depending on the insights you need, would incredibly be valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other end of the spectrum, open text field questions allow people 
      to offer more detailed personal responses, providing deep insights into 
      the ‘why’ behind their answers. However, analyzing these responses is 
      somewhat trickier and requires more time to process so open text fields 
      should be limited to questions that require deeper thought and opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Where to start:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are plenty of great online survey builders out there that are easy 
      to use and completely customizable. Whether you’re a research pro or 
      just getting started here are a few of our favourites to get you off 
      the ground. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Google survey:</strong> This is a great starting point for creating simple 
      surveys. It provides unlimited surveys, unlimited respondents, and data 
      is automatically collected in Google Spreadsheets. Surveys can be 
      embedded into emails or websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jotform:</strong> There are multiple packages available depending on your needs. 
      With the free version, you have access to 5 surveys and 100 monthly 
      submissions. Paid versions offer more surveys, more monthly submissions, 
      unlimited storage for response collection, and customizable branding 
      among other features.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Surveymonkey:</strong> This well-designed platform is pretty easy to use and it 
      gives you the option to embed surveys. However, unless you purchase the 
      paid version, there is a limit to the number of questions and responses 
      you can have and you are not permitted to export your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Typeform:</strong> The free version offers some great features, especially 
      unlimited questions and answers. Their interface is also quite attractive 
      and you can export all your data, even with the free version.

      Customer feedback software
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking to conduct ongoing tests of user experience on your website, 
      prototype, app or software? Implementing unmoderated testing with 
      customer feedback software will help you do just that. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        What is feedback software?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Feedback software is designed to help businesses collect, measure, and 
      analyze customer feedback right on your website or product’s interface. 
      These are tools that allow you to collect valuable insight from customers 
      while they are interacting with your product. They can help you understand how your customers feel about your product, lets them show you their pain points and directs you to areas that need to be improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        How does it work?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The software allows your users to provide feedback on your site or 
      product without you having to prepare questions, be present or interact 
      with them at all. Through a widget, people will identify bugs and 
      usability issues you would never have found on your own. This is 
      especially useful for instances when every customer’s journey is 
      different, making it impossible to test all potential situations. 
      Widgets also help you connect with people who are passionate about your
       product since they are already users. That way, if you ever need to 
       conduct in-person testing, you already have trusted users to facilitate 
       testing with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to other methods of unmoderated testing, feedback widgets will 
      provide you with a high volume of feedback, a lot of which will be similar. 
      Also, widgets do not allow for instant interactions with the users, so it 
      is impossible to ask the user any follow-up questions or seek 
      clarification on what they say to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding widgets to your product also opens up feedback to any individual 
      who tries your product or visits your website, meaning you might get 
      feedback from undesirable users and even receive harsh messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But! Sometimes the people who leave the angriest message are the most 
      passionate about your product. Don’t get discouraged by outraged feedback.
       Instead, prioritize following up with these people. You are likely to 
       find they are your biggest allies when they are heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        When to use feedback software
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Feedback software is worthwhile when your website already has a good 
      amount of traffic or your product already has a large user base. This 
      software is meant for when people come to you. It does not require you 
      to recruit or send tests to people first. So, if your website or app 
      doesn’t have a lot of traffic, you won’t get much feedback. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Use software when you’re looking for feedback on general usability 
      testing, want a heads up if someone comes across a bug, or if you’re 
      just looking for user feedback on a long-term basis. Also, feedback 
      software can only be used when your app or website is live. Software 
      is meant for improving an established product over time, so don’t use 
      them in the prototyping stages or during the design and research phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Get Started:

    </p>
    <p>
      In the world of feedback software, <a href="https://usersnap.com?ref=sixzero_ebook" target="_blank">Usersnap</a> is one of the top web 
      applications for generating feedback, efficiently from your users. 
      It integrates seamlessly with any website or app and compiles data 
      into one easy-to-use dashboard. Set up is straightforward with feedback 
      options ready to be implemented right away. Users can report a bug, 
      provide general feedback, or contact support just by clicking on the 
      widget that you add to your site. When a user launches the widget and 
      selects the type of feedback they want to give, they can screenshot the 
      area on the site where they are having issues and provide a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once feedback is collected into your dashboard, Usersnap lets you 
      assign a task to the team member who is in charge of it, making it 
      perfect for cross-team collaboration and easy project management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usersnap also lets you add customizable feedback forms that allow you 
      to collect relevant and valuable product insights by issuing feedback 
      surveys through website pop-ups. And lastly, but potentially most 
      empowering, Usersnap allows for users to suggest new features that 
      they would like in your product, removing any of the guesswork as to 
      what your users want.

      The takeaways
    </h2>
    <p>
      Moving away from one-on-one testing is an opportunity to conduct more 
      user tests with more people at the same time. In addition to one-on-one 
      testing, one of the three methods outlined above will surely help guide 
      your course in acquiring a variety of insights to improve your product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t forget user testing is never a one-and-done event. We encourage 
      you to continue to implement your new skills to conduct continuous tests, 
      both big and small, in-person and scaled. We promise you’ll always 
      discover new ways to upgrade your product to better achieve product-market 
      fit and build something people can’t (or don’t want to) live without.
