      <p>
        Good preparation when it comes to setup will ensure your test runs smoothly
        without any hiccups. Before your participant arrives &mdash; whether in person or
        remotely &mdash; consider the following:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Comfort.</strong> Find a comfortable and convenient space to conduct the space so
        participants feel at ease. This may mean hosting them at your office, going
        to their houses, meeting in the middle, or syncing up remotely. And
        remember: Snacks make almost anyone feel more at ease!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visibility.</strong> Ensure you have a clear view of your participant’s device. If
        they’re not sitting next to you, have them share their screen so you can
        see their behaviour as you listen to their commentary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tech.</strong> Are you set to record? Is the sound also recording? There’s nothing
        worse than conducting a test only to realize you forgot to record the
        session.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="facilitate-like-a-pro">Facilitate like a pro</h3>
    <p>
      Being a good facilitator requires more than just reading off the script
      and taking detailed notes. Remember, you’re dealing with real people &mdash;
      the more at ease they feel the better your results.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="reassure-the-participant">Reassure the participant</h4>
    <p>
      Participants can be quite nervous or even self conscious before these
      tests. If they’ve never met you or done a user test before, it can be
      pretty intimidating! Do your best to make them feel comfortable. In the
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQ0Ydukoh80d7CdEIdJTKdt4J1-9mS_YjuVXNR8_zcM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">script example</a>, we’ve included a few things you might say to help
      participants understand the process and feel at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our favorite way to reassure people is to tell them that we’re working
      together to make the app better, and that they can do no wrong! We also
      tell them they can’t hurt our feelings, which seems to empower them to
      say what’s really on their mind. Buckle up!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="practice-active-listening">Practice active listening</h4>
    <p>
      Once you’ve broken the ice, gotten comfortable, and actually start asking
      questions, it’s time to focus on being a great listener. That doesn’t mean
      simply being silent &mdash; it means allowing the person to trail off and explore
      their thoughts without jumping in. Allowing users to think out loud like
      this can yield some of the best information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="avoid-leading-questions">Avoid leading questions</h4>
    <p>
      One of the most common mistakes we see is people asking leading questions.
      It’s important to remember you’re trying to get the user to give you their
      most raw take on what they are thinking and feeling. If you ask a leading
      question to get a desired response you’ve missed a valuable opportunity to
      see an unfiltered view of their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following example of a leading question:
      <br>
      <em>Is it clear that the button will lead to the checkout page?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now compare it to this non-leading question:
      <br>
      <em>What do you expect to happen when you click on that button?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas in the first example, you’ll likely get a simple yes or no answer,
      the second example creates space for the participant to share their thoughts
      and insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our experience, a great way to combat leading questions is to just ask “Why?”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the same example above of a non-leading question, let’s say the
      participant answered, “I expected it to go to the FAQ page” &mdash; to which you
      would respond, “Why?”. Again, this gives the participant a chance to explain
      their rationale, and you an opportunity to learn from their experience.
    </p>
    <div class="callout" id="the-5-whys">
      <h5 class="callout__title">The 5 Whys</h5>
      <p>
        Just like five participants gives you the best results, asking five whys
        may provide you with insight into the root cause of a problem. For more on
        this technique, check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">this out</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="let-people-go-off-script">Let people go off script</h4>
    <p>
      It’s tempting to stay on script because you’ve spent so much time planning,
      but tests often go in unexpected directions. These tangents can often bring
      you unexpected and high-value discoveries that you would have never considered
      otherwise. The whole purpose of user testing is to capture someone else's
      perspective of how your product works. Allowing people to go off course
      gives you a larger and more detailed version of their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if a user starts going into their thoughts on navigation when
      you’re talking about adding a photo, let it happen. Worst case scenario
      you get some free insights into another piece of the app, best case you
      have a game-changing moment.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="be-a-mirror">Be a mirror</h4>
    <p>
      Mirroring is another effective method of drawing deeper insights from your
      test participants &mdash; especially if you’re having trouble getting the
      participant to talk openly, or if they’re not providing enough detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      To leverage mirroring in your tests, repeat the critical one to three words
      your test participant just said and then pause. It’s important to wait a
      good few seconds before moving on to the next prompt &mdash; even if it feels a
      bit awkward. This strategy does three key things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Helps your test participant feel more comfortable. Since people are
        naturally drawn to the familiar, mirroring participants’ language
        encourages bonding and rapport building.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides an opening for the participant to elaborate on what they’ve just
        said. The reason pausing feels awkward is because it is &mdash; and most people
        will continue talking to avoid feeling the discomfort. The result may be
        an extra juicy insight you wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="take-limited-notes">Take limited notes</h4>
    <p>
      Along with being a good listener, it’s important to be fully present to
      observe and ask questions and get a detailed view of what the person is
      doing. We suggest taking as few written notes as possible. Writing,
      listening, and watching all at once is not possible. Keep in mind, the
      session is being recorded, so don’t worry, everything will be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually our only notes consist of timestamps of critical moments so we can
      revisit them on the recording later.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you really need notes, we suggest enlisting another person to be your note
      taker while you focus on facilitating.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="keep-the-session-small">Keep the session small</h4>
    <p>
      It’s important to invite as few people in the room as possible. If there are
      too many people, the user test starts to feel like an exam rather than a
      group effort to make the product better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our tests are done with no more than two facilitators in the room
      with one person delivering the test and the other acting as a note taker.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid making the participant feel like they’re being tested, make sure
      you let them know the second person is only there to observe and take notes,
      and that you’ll be the only one asking questions. Also, consider explaining
      to the participant that it’s important both you and notetaker are able to
      see the participant’s screen, which is why you’re all sitting on the same
      side of the table. Again, this will help make the participant feel more
      comfortable.
