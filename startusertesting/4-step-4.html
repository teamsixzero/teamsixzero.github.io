    <h3 id="set-up-your-test">Set up your test</h3>
      <p>
        Good preparation when it comes to setup will ensure your test runs smoothly 
        without any hiccups. Before your participant arrives &mdash; whether in person or 
        remotely &mdash; consider the following:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Comfort.</strong> Find a comfortable and convenient space to conduct the space so 
        participants feel at ease. This may mean hosting them at your office, going 
        to their houses, meeting in the middle, or syncing up remotely. And 
        remember: Snacks make almost anyone feel more at ease!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visibility.</strong> Ensure you have a clear view of your participant’s device. If 
        they’re not sitting next to you, have them share their screen so you can 
        see their behaviour as you listen to their commentary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tech.</strong> Are you set to record? Is the sound also recording? There’s nothing 
        worse than conducting a test only to realize you forgot to record the 
        session.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="facilitate-like-a-pro">Facilitate like a pro</h3>
    <p>
      Being a good facilitator requires more than just reading off the script 
      and taking detailed notes. Remember, you’re dealing with real people &mdash; 
      the more at ease they feel the better your results.
    </p>

    <h3 id="reassure-the-participant">Reassure the participant</h3>
      <p>
        Participants can be quite nervous or even self conscious before these 
        tests. If they’ve never met you or done a user test before, it can be 
        pretty intimidating! Do your best to make them feel comfortable. In the 
        <a href="#">script example</a>, we’ve included a few things you might say to help 
        participants understand the process and feel at ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our favorite way to reassure people is to tell them that we’re working 
        together to make the app better, and that they can do no wrong! We also 
        tell them they can’t hurt our feelings, which seems to empower them to 
        say what’s really on their mind. Buckle up!
      </p>

    <h3 id="practice-active-listening">Practice active listening</h3>
      <p>
        Once you’ve broken the ice, gotten comfortable, and actually start asking 
        questions, it’s time to focus on being a great listener. That doesn’t mean 
        simply being silent &mdash; it means allowing the person to trail off and explore 
        their thoughts without jumping in. Allowing users to think out loud like 
        this can yield some of the best information.
      </p>

    <h3 id="avoid-leading-questions">Avoid leading questions</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most common mistakes we see is people asking leading questions. 
      It’s important to remember you’re trying to get the user to give you their 
      most raw take on what they are thinking and feeling. If you ask a leading 
      question to get a desired response you’ve missed a valuable opportunity to 
      see an unfiltered view of their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following example of a leading question:
      <ul>
        <li>Is it clear that the button will lead to the checkout page?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now compare it to this non-leading question:
      <ul>
        <li>What do you expect to happen when you click on that button?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas in the first example, you’ll likely get a simple yes or no answer, 
      the second example creates space for the participant to share their thoughts 
      and insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our experience, a great way to combat leading questions is to just ask “Why?”.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the same example above of a non-leading question, let’s say the 
      participant answered, “I expected it to go to the FAQ page” &mdash; to which you 
      would respond, “Why?”. Again, this gives the participant a chance to explain 
      their rationale, and you an opportunity to learn from their experience.
    </p>
    <div class="callout" id="the-5-whys">
      <h4>The 5 Whys</h4>
      <p>
        Just like five participants gives you the best results, asking five whys 
        may provide you with insight into the root cause of a problem. For more on 
        this technique, check <a href="#">this out</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="let-people-go-off-script">Let people go off script</h3>
    <p>
      It’s tempting to stay on script because you’ve spent so much time planning, 
      but tests often go in unexpected directions. These tangents can often bring 
      you unexpected and high-value discoveries that you would have never considered 
      otherwise. The whole purpose of user testing is to capture someone else's 
      perspective of how your product works. Allowing people to go off course 
      gives you a larger and more detailed version of their experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if a user starts going into their thoughts on navigation when 
      you’re talking about adding a photo, let it happen. Worst case scenario 
      you get some free insights into another piece of the app, best case you 
      have a game-changing moment.
    </p>

    <h3 id="be-a-mirror">Be a mirror</h3>
    <p>
      Mirroring is another effective method of drawing deeper insights from your 
      test participants &mdash; especially if you’re having trouble getting the 
      participant to talk openly, or if they’re not providing enough detail.
    </p> 
    <p>
      To leverage mirroring in your tests, repeat the critical one to three words 
      your test participant just said and then pause. It’s important to wait a 
      good few seconds before moving on to the next prompt &mdash; even if it feels a 
      bit awkward. This strategy does three key things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Helps your test participant feel more comfortable. Since people are 
        naturally drawn to the familiar, mirroring participants’ language 
        encourages bonding and rapport building.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides an opening for the participant to elaborate on what they’ve just 
        said. The reason pausing feels awkward is because it is &mdash; and most people 
        will continue talking to avoid feeling the discomfort. The result may be 
        an extra juicy insight you wouldn’t have gotten otherwise.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="take-limited-notes">Take limited notes</h3>
    <p>
      Along with being a good listener, it’s important to be fully present to 
      observe and ask questions and get a detailed view of what the person is 
      doing. We suggest taking as few written notes as possible. Writing, 
      listening, and watching all at once is not possible. Keep in mind, the 
      session is being recorded, so don’t worry, everything will be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually our only notes consist of timestamps of critical moments so we can 
      revisit them on the recording later.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you really need notes, we suggest enlisting another person to be your note 
      taker while you focus on facilitating.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keep-the-session-small">Keep the session small</h3>
    <p>
      It’s important to invite as few people in the room as possible. If there are 
      too many people, the user test starts to feel like an exam rather than a 
      group effort to make the product better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our tests are done with no more than two facilitators in the room 
      with one person delivering the test and the other acting as a note taker.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid making the participant feel like they’re being tested, make sure 
      you let them know the second person is only there to observe and take notes, 
      and that you’ll be the only one asking questions. Also, consider explaining 
      to the participant that it’s important both you and notetaker are able to 
      see the participant’s screen, which is why you’re all sitting on the same 
      side of the table. Again, this will help make the participant feel more 
      comfortable.
