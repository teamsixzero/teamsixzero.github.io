      Decide what you are testing
    </h3>
    <p>
      Tempting as it might be to test #allthethings, it’s just not possible &mdash; at
      least not in a single day. Instead, focus on what’s most important to your
      users. You probably already have a hunch about a feature or task that’s not
      working in your app, either from intuition, customer feedback, or data,
      so start there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t know what to focus on, get a new user to sign up for your app
      and give them the task of using your core functionality. For example, if you
      were facilitating testing for Airbnb, you would ask your participant to
      create an account and complete a booking. <em> The more it hurts to watch the
      more valuable it is. Don’t look away!</em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="decide-what-you-want-to-understand">
      Decide what you want to understand
    </h3>

    <p>
      Now that you’ve decided which feature or task to test you likely have a
      hypothesis on why it’s not working as expected.
    </p>

    <p>
    List out all the reasons why you believe users are having trouble. Using the
    Airbnb example again, it would look something like this:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We want to understand if users know what Airbnb is based on the home page.</li>
      <li>We want to understand if users are able to create an account successfully.</li>
      <li>We want to understand if users can use the date picker correctly. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These questions will become the foundation of your test outline and script.
