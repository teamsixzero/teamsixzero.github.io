      As a general rule, you’ll get more detailed feedback the more detailed
      and functional your prototype. But you don't always need detailed feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re looking for high-level feedback on a concept or idea for
      example &mdash; something like, “This is great” or “This seems unnecessary”
      &mdash; then you can get away with a minimally functioning prototype,
      like a paper prototype or clickable wireframes made in Sketch or Figma
      (referred to as a low- or mid-fidelity prototype).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to test a complex feature or a bunch of
      connected screens that would be really difficult to simulate with simple
      sketches or wireframes, you'll have to increase the functionality and
      detail. In other words, you’d need to create a prototype with a higher
      level of fidelity.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      <h6 class="callout__title">What is design fidelity?</h6>
      <p>
        Design fidelity refers to the level of functionality and detail of a
        prototype, which can be categorized as either low, mid, or high-fidelity.
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Low-fidelity prototypes</strong> may include only sticky
          notes, hand-drawn sketches, or very simple black-and-white wireframes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mid-fidelity prototypes</strong> consist of more detailed
          wireframes with basic functionality, such as the ability to click on
          links or buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High-fidelity prototypes</strong> are closest to the finished
          product in appearance and functionality. They may include coded
          prototypes, if you feel it’s the only way to simulate reality and
          get the answers you need.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      Achieving the right level of fidelity is a balancing act and depends
      heavily upon how much detail you need in your feedback to continue
      moving forward with confidence. The trick then is <strong>faking reality just
      enough so the user buys it, while putting in the minimum amount of
      effort to create the prototype as possible.</strong> As tempting as it may be
      to present your testers with something beautiful and polished, building
      something super detailed too early on would require you to make a
      bunch of assumptions and waste a bunch of time, which is &mdash; ultimately
      &mdash; what user testing serves to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, we’ve found users are pretty great at playing pretend.
      Of course, if your prototype &mdash; no matter the level of fidelity &mdash; is
      full of bugs or dead ends, it will pull the user out of the experience
      and ruin the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      An easy way to avoid this is to run through your test yourself, start
      to finish, as well as to recruit a colleague to test the test ahead of
      time to make sure any rough spots are smoothed out.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="set-the-stage-with-a-realistic-scenario">
      Set the stage with a realistic scenario
    </h3>
    <p>
      Giving users a realistic scenario provides the context they need to
      successfully perform a task. This is when you’ll want to consider introducing
      specific constraints that will help frame their thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let’s say you’re doing a test for Airbnb, and you’d like to
      improve the user experience for guests booking last-minute vacations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice that looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Imagine you’re trying to book a trip under a tight timeline. How might you
      go about getting a house booked in New York for next weekend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the scenario above, the constraints include: booking type (house),
      location (New York), timeframe (next weekend).
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="write-your-script">
      Write your script
    </h3>
    <p>
      By this point you’ve already defined what you want to understand and created
      a realistic scenario. Use these details to guide your script.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you want to find out “if users are able to create an account
      successfully,” make sure there’s a question in your script for that.
      Remember: Each statement should have an accompanying question in the script.
      If we use the example above, we’d want to make sure there was a question
      like, “How do you think you would create an account?”
    </p>
    <p>
      As you create the rest of your script, try to imagine what your user will be
      experiencing and craft your questions accordingly. A good exercise for this
      is to walk through your prototype like step-by-step. The point here is to
      anticipate what your participants might find difficult so you can ensure
      you have questions prepared to tease out why they’re finding it difficult.

    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about this in advance will give you confidence going into the
      session, which puts your participants at ease. Not only that, you’ll ask
      better follow-up questions, keep things on track, and recover more easily
      if things go way off the rails
    </p>

    <h6 class="callout__title">Follow-up questions</h6>
    <p>
      You don’t need to be a journalist to come up with great follow-up
      questions, you just need to be curious. For example, when a participant
      says they like or don’t like something, ask them:
      <ul>
        <li>What don’t you/do you like about it?</li>
        <li>How might you improve it?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant is surprised by something, ask them:
      <ul>
        <li>Why were you surprised?</li>
        <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of a new flow or feature, ask participants:
      <ul>
        <li>What do you think this is?</li>
        <li>What are your initial impressions, thoughts, and feelings?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant breezes through something important, stop them and ask:
      <ul>
        <li>Did you notice it? Why not?</li>
        <li>Do you care?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a user has completed a flow, ask them:
      <ul>
        <li>What were your overall impressions?</li>
        <li>Did it match your impression of it before you started?</li>
        <li>Was it valuable?</li>
        <li>What did you like?</li>
        <li>What did you dislike?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="dont-forget-the-software-usability-scale">Don’t forget the ‘Software Usability Scale</h3>
    <p>
      Developed in 1986, the Software Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for
      measuring the usability of your product.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the SUS is used, participants are asked to score the following 10 items
      on a scale of one to five, with ‘Strongly Disagree’ (1) on one end and
      ‘Strongly Agree’ (5) on the other.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I think that I would like to use this system frequently.</li>
      <li>I found the system unnecessarily complex.</li>
      <li>I thought the system was easy to use.</li>
      <li>I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.</li>
      <li>I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.</li>
      <li>I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.</li>
      <li>I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.</li>
      <li>I found the system very cumbersome to use.</li>
      <li>I felt very confident using the system.</li>
      <li>I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Including the SUS in every usability test has the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provides your team with a baseline usability score. When you’ve completed
        all your user tests, either add all the scores together for an overall
        score, or find the average.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows you to compare scores between tests. Did one user score something
        higher than another user? This may provide additional insights regarding the
        usability of your product with respect to different personas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gives you leverage when convincing stakeholders where you invest time
        and resources. It also lets you easily demonstrate to stakeholders how
        your product has improved as you do more and more tests down the line.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      In terms of when to ask these questions, we suggest at the end of every script.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="test-the-test">
      Test the test
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the best pieces of advice we can offer is to do a couple dry runs of
      the test on anyone you can find, whether a coworker or a friend. Don’t worry
      about getting someone who matches your perfect user &mdash; dry runs are for making
      sure your script makes sense and nothing feels awkward or confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your real participants are participating remotely, a dry run will also
      give you the opportunity to see if it makes sense without you sitting right
      next to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, use the dry run to time your test. We find between 1 and 1.5 hours
      to be the sweet spot for getting value while keeping your participant
      engaged &mdash; any longer and everyone in the room starts to get tired. Long
      tests also create a mountain of recordings to parse after the fact, which
      can be time consuming and repetitive.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="modify-as-you-go">Modify as you go</h3>
    <p>
      You may discover a problem very early on in your tests and wonder if it’s
      necessary to watch all five of your testers struggle with the same thing.
      It’s absolutely not, and here’s why: These aren't scientific tests, but
      rather opportunities to observe real users interacting with a product
      you're intimately familiar with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas a true experiment would require a scientific hypothesis which you
      either prove or disprove with clean data, <strong>user tests are a structured way
      to discover if something sucks &mdash; and sometimes you only need to see
      it once to know it's worth changing.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, making tweaks on the fly allows you to test things faster and
      uncover deeper insights. In fact, some of the best insights we’ve gotten
      were the result of subtle changes we made over the course of several tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s how that might look in practice:
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say your first two testers really struggle with finding the
      "My Account” page. Rather than watching three more people struggle for
      the sake of data, you could instead choose to fix the problem between
      tests &mdash; by changing the colour of the button, for example &mdash; and then
      ask the next user to perform the same task using the new flow. Should
      the problem be resolved you’re then free to address the next problem
      and then the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've often done 3-4 changes between tests, resolving issues from
      previous tests and testing the new iterations. This often gets us much
      further than painstakingly adhering to the original test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things you might consider tweaking in between tests include:
      <ul>
        <li>changes to the test itself</li>
        <li>asking a different question</li>
        <li>posing a scenario differently</li>
        <li>
          making changes to the UI to fix obvious issues from early tests that
          hung people up
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there are situations in which you might not want to change the
      test. Like, for example, if you’re trying to persuade a stakeholder with
      data (e.g., “We need to allocate resources to fixing XYZ because testing
      shows five out of five people struggled with it.”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if you identify a problem, but the solution doesn’t seem obvious
      or it’s obvious but it would require big changes &mdash; don’t change the test.
      Instead, let your testers run the test until you have enough data and
      you’re confident you know what the problem is and why it exists. Only
      then will the obvious solution be revealed. (We know, it’s cheesy &mdash;
      but it’s also true.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We've tested entire cohorts where we change nothing, because we don't
      have a deep enough understanding of the problem, or we need to demonstrate
      to a stakeholder just how deep the problem runs. We've also done tests
      where we change lots of stuff, and it proved the solution in one cohort.
      In short, <strong>use your judgement, and treat user testing as an adaptable
      tool versus a set of rules.</strong>
