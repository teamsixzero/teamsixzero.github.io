Risk-taking is an inherent part of the DNA of startups and tech companies. 
It’s how big companies like Apple, Amazon and Google have produced some of 
the most innovative products of our time. 

But while launching the first-of-its-kind product comes with business-related 
risks, the actual design of the product probably isn’t very risky at all. 

Really, great design only seems like it’s taking risks because we don't know 
all the work that went into arriving at the output that they did.  So next time 
you deem a product’s design as "risky", I would argue that, when it comes to 
design, it’s the designer’s job to make the product function in a way that will 
resonate with users, even if it’s new or different. 

In other words, every design decision that appears risky to us outsiders is 
deeply considered and is based on LOTS of critical thinking, careful calculation, 
and often the rules of design have been thoroughly considered at every take. 

Remember: it is not a designer‘s job to take risks in what they design, but to 
eliminate as many risks as possible through a process of validating ideas 
through <a href="/startusertesting/" target="_blank">research</a>, checking 
assumptions, considering conventional design rules 
and never designing on just instinct.
