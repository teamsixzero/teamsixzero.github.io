Yes you can. You just need to think like a designer. 

Here’s how to go about that:

1. Challenge your assumptions early and often: before you start building, as 
soon as you start building, once it’s released and then over and over again.

2. Have conversations with your customers: find (potential) users, show them 
early prototypes, and <a href="/startusertesting/" target="_blank">do usability 
testing</a>. This process is cheaper than spending a year building a product 
that no one wants.

3. Build accordingly: bring together an internal team to look at the findings, 
create a sense of shared understanding and come up with a solution based on 
everything you learned.

4. Repeat this process over and over. In fact, make it a part of your culture. 
When you do, you will see that spending time with your users will yield a deeper 
understanding of their needs, which will allow you to make a product that 
resonates with them even more.

If start-ups and business owners start developing a habit of checking their 
assumptions long before they jump into design and development, they can be 
sure they are creating a tool that is invaluable for their users, every 
single time.
