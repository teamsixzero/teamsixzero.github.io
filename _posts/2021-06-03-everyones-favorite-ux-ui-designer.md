Early in my career as a UX Designer, I thought it was my job to know all the 
answers. I never asked for input because I thought it would expose me as a fraud. 

This led me to years of designing in a silo, being defensive of my work, and 
creating (if I'm really honest) hot garbage design work.

I’ve come a long way since those days. Now I approach each project not as the 
expert in the problem itself, but as an expert in going out and finding the 
solution. Here’s how you can do it too: 

1. Approach every problem with a beginner’s mentality: the less you pretend 
to know about the problem, the better you will be at uncovering the right solution.

2. Discard your assumptions: first look for all the ways that you might be 
wrong. Then it’s your job to gather all the information you need to build the right thing first.

3. Always be asking for input: establish trust and empathy by encouraging 
all stakeholders to share their vision of the problem and solution. 

4. Be ok with being wrong: be open to all opinions and above all else, never 
take it personally. 

5. Let go of your ego: the power of great design comes from being the person 
who has the courage to put their work under the microscope and have it examined 
by your peers in order to find the best possible solution.

By approaching each project as a beginner, facilitating the conversation and 
collaboration to uncover the right solutions for your users, you will not only 
become known as a designer who people rave about working with but one that 
always produces great outcomes.
