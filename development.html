    <h2 class="h4 project__name">We connect design and development, effectively</h4>
    <p>Developers are involved early on in the planning and design stages so that they are consulted on the feasibility of all features. This ensures that our vision for an intuitive user experience can actually be brought into reality.</p>
    <p>Seeking early input from developers leads to shortened timelines for development and more accurate outcomes early, resulting in more cost-effective solutions.</p>

        "This is what you asked for" isn't in our vocabulary. We know that deliverables can evolve with new data and are committed to partnering with you until the final product is just right.
