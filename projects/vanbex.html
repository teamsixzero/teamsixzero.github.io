        The Brief
      </h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain and Cryptocurrency websites are often hard to understand.
        They can be full of buzzwords and can feel like they were designed more
        for bots than people.
      </p>
      <p>
        We worked with Vanbex to kill the complexity and bring a human focus to
        their marketing website. Potential customers needed to clearly understand
        what Vanbex did, how they did it, and what set them apart from every other
        blockchain company out there.
      </p>

      Simplify
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our first challenge: Vanbex needed to clearly explain and showcase all
      the services they offered. The team found that potential customers would
      often say they weren&rsquo;t aware of what services were available or
      that the services they were aware of needed to be clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meant showcasing popular services on the home page and creating
      a straightforward services page with more details.

      Build Trust
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our second challenge: Build trust. Vanbex has so much experience in the
      blockchain space and plenty of big names in their client list, so why
      not use that to build trust with new visitors and potential clients?
    </p>
    <p>
      This translated into a success stories section that offered quotes from
      each company and a clients page that explained each project in more
      detail, including the services they used.

      <h2 class="h4 project__name">Differentiate</h2>
      <p>
        Having been around since 2013 Vanbex is a more mature company than most
        in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency space, and they wanted their
        website to reflect that. The design of the site needed to match their
        company values and look totally different from everything else while
        still looking futuristic and trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focused on a color palette that was more fintech than blockchain,
        lots of white, simple typography, and clean modern illustrations.
        The design needed to stand out, without standing in the way.
