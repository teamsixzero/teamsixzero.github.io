        User Groups
      </h4>
      <p>
        It wasn&rsquo;t until we started talking to customers that we recognized 
        how different each use case for Groups was. After extensive user research 
        and iteration we designed User Groups to give every Thinkific school a 
        better way to organize existing students and sell to new ones.

      Main Menu
    </h4>
    <p>
      We redesigned the Thinkific main navigation to be friendlier, more 
      powerful for everyone, and include global search. With such a diverse 
      user base we spent a lot of time understanding what instructors
      disliked about the existing navigation, how they navigated the app, and 
      what features they used the most in order to understand how we could 
      improve their experience and productivity.

      <p>
        One of the biggest complaints Thinkific got was about the beauty and 
        flexibility of their website themes &mdash; a huge component of the 
        Thinkific platform. Users wanted their sites to match their brand and 
        unique content but the existing system just wasn&rsquo;t flexible enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        We helped design a flexible platform that allows developers and 
        designers to create totally unique, beautiful, and fully customizable 
        websites, empowering Thinkific instructors to fully tailor their site to 
        their needs without any design skills.

      <p>
        Thousands of instructors use the Course Builder every day to create and 
        manage their online courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        We heard time and time again from users that they were painters, 
        sailing instructors, or yoga teachers, not web designers. We designed 
        the course builder to be intuitive so instructors of all technical 
        abilities could create an online course without having to hire a team 
        of developers.

      Purchase Flow
    </h4>
    <p>
      Accepting money from eagar course creators should have been easy, but we 
      heard from many Thinkific users that the payment experience wasn&rsquo;t 
      easy or confidence inspiring. We worked to remove the friction and give 
      users all the information they needed to confidently make a decision and 
      get their online course out into the world no matter what device they 
      were on.
