        Shopping for new shoes online can be daunting. Finding cool new brands 
        and unique styles is a challenge, and sizing is always a huge risk. 
        While companies do plenty of things to help reduce anxiety and inspire 
        confidence while purchasing, there is always a little voice saying 
        &ldquo;I really hope these fit!&rdquo;.

      <h6 class="intro__copy"> 
        FTSY approached us to help them improve the shoe shopping experience so 
        that everyone can feel confident and find the perfect pair without the 
        stress.

      User experience testing
    </h4>
    <p>
      Our first priority was to gain a deep understanding of how potential FTSY 
      users went about shopping for shoes online. We wanted to learn what 
      worries them, what they like or dislike, and what makes a good shopping 
      experience. We also needed to know how well the existing FTSY app 
      performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, we did 5 individual user testing sessions. During the 
      interviews, we dug deep and figured out what each person&rsquo;s vision of a 
      great shopping experience looked liked and got each person to try the 
      FTSY app. The thoughts and insights they shared were invaluable.
    </p>
    <p class="has-no-padding-bottom ">
      We used the findings from these sessions as the foundation for our redesign.

      <p>
        Our testing sessions told us to focus on features that would help 
        shoppers make a purchase more confidently. That meant concentrating on 
        the product pages. We redesigned the page from the ground up. We made 
        the images larger so you could see every 
        last detail, we showed the available colours and price more prominently, 
        we made the product descriptions easier to find, and showed the sizing 
        front and center.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also changed the purchase button. Test participants described being 
        surprised or hesitant to press the button in the original app because 
        they were unsure of the next step. A colour and copy change removed 
        those worries.

          5 out of 5 test participants told us over and over that they just wanted 
          to get to the good part &mdash; the shoes! 
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant redefining the structure of the app, and removing parts 
          of the onboarding flow that caused so much confusion. We wanted people 
          to freely browse all the unique shoes as quickly as possible so they 
          could fall in love before they needed to scan their feet and enter 
          any account details.

      <h4 class="project__name">The magic ingredient</h4>
      <p>
        FTSY&rsquo;s proprietary scanning technology is the magic ingredient in 
        the FTSY sauce. The AI-driven mobile scanner builds a 3D model by taking 
        multiple photos of shoppers feet. Photos are turned into accurate foot 
        models with an understanding of shape, such as arches and pronation, 
        which impact how a foot will feel in a shoe.
      </p>
      <p>
        While our participants loved the idea, they pointed out several areas 
        in which the user experience could be made more intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        We designed a scanning experience that is much faster and easier to 
        use by focusing clear instructions, a better sense of progress, and 
        a clearer UI.
